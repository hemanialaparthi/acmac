here are some of the things that still need to be done to finish up the website. most of these involve needing images, the color scheme, the logo, and links for socials. we can also customize more on top of this.

- the readme
- /public --> add the new acm logo
- syle.css and index.css for color changes
- /assets --> we need a photo of every board member. ideally a professional one and linkedins too
- /assets --> we also need general images of acm events to put up
- /constants --> needs updated to show the photos and linkedins too
- /constants --> needs to be updated to show the events
- /components/navbar --> change social links
- we also should credit university of buffalo at the end of this
